JVM Memory:
-- Stack: to store variables
   -- FILO 
   -- Automatically-assigned by JVM|OS
-- Heap: to store objects|instances
   -- FIFO 
   -- Manually-assiend by programmer
-- Method Area: to store compiled java files
   -- Refer to "javase.testReflection.java"

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): refer to "javase.TestOOP.java"
4 Features:
-- Encapsulation: privatization for protection (e.g. JavaBean)
-- Abstraction: extraction of common features
-- Inheritance: Subclass can gain the ability of superclass (& enhance the abliity of themselves)
-- Polymorphism: Superclass can refer to the object of any subclass
Achievement:
-- Higher cohesion & lower coupling

Array|Tree|Link|Hash: 
-- Array: sorted & ordered
   -- Fast for query, slow for addition|removal
-- Link: ordered & unsorted
   -- Fast for addition|removal, slow for query
-- Tree: sorted but unordered
-- Hash: unsorted & unordered

List|Set|Map:
-- List: duplicable & sorted 
-- Set: unduplicable & unsorted
-- Map: key-value pair

Thread:
2 ways of implementing thread: extends Thread|implements Runnable

Serialization: 
-- Store the state of an object in a file or other medium
-- Used for file storage or tranmission: in the environment with distributed cache

New features:
-- Generics, Enumrate, Autoboxing (wrapper class), Annoation, Static import, etc.
-- Wrapper class:
   -- Boolean, [Byte, Character], [Int, Short, Long, Float, Double]
   -- Autoboxing & unboxing
