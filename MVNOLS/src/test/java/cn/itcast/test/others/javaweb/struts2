What is Struts2?
-- MVC-based pluggable web-application framework
   -- Pluggbale component: interceptor, etc.

What is MVC?
-- An architectural design pattern to improve the program robustness, scalability & flexibility
-- M (Model): contain the data and behavior for business logic
   -- Can be realized by JavaBean
-- V (View): for presentation to user based on the change of the model
   -- Can be realized by JSP
-- C (Controller): to control the working flow
   -- Can be realized by Servlet: accpet, process and dispatch the request
   
Differences between Struts1 and Struts2
-- Stucts2 merges Webwork; Struts1 is independent product
-- Struts2 introduces interceptors; Struts1 have no interceptors

Differencs between interceptor and filter: interceptor has wider range of application
-- Mechanism:
   -- Interceptor: reflection-based; Filter: callback-based (defined by JavaEE standard)
-- Working depth:
   -- Interceptor: work on method-level (around method); Fitler: work on class-level (around servlet)
-- Web container dependency:
   -- Interceptor: independent on web containr; Filter: dependent on web container (e.g., Tomcat) 
-- IOC container interaction:
   -- Interceptor: can get the bean from IOC container (e.g., Spring); Filter: cannot get beans from IOC container
-- Range of application:
   -- Interceptor: work on many programs (web, application, etc.); Filter: work on only web program
-- Request processing:
   -- Interceptor: work on the request to action; Filter: work on all requests

Interceptors in Struts2:
-- ModelDrivenInterceptor: push the model onto ValueStack
-- TokenInterceptor: avoid duplicate submission
-- ValidationInterceptor: validate request parameters
-- etc.

Action chaining: Multiple action serving the request in chain

OGNL (Object-Graph Navagation Language):
-- an EL to manipulate the properties of JavaBean
-- in Struts2 used to interact with ValueStack|StackContext
