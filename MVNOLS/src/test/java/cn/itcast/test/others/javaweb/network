WS (Web Service):
What is WS (Web Service):
-- A platform-independent remote invocation technique for data exchange between 2 devices|servers through SOAP|HTTP
-- SOAP-based specification: JAX-WS, JAXM&SAAJ
   -- SOAP-based specification: JAX-WS, JAXM&SAAJ
      -- JAX-WS (Java API for XML-based Web Service): use SOAP for data transmission & WSDL for WS functionality description
      -- JAXM&SAAJ (Java API for XML Message & SOAP with Attachcment API for Java): same as above
      -- 3 Elements: SOAP, WSDL, UDDI
-- HTTP-based specification: JAX-RS 
   -- JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Service): use HTTP for data transmission & more lighter

Comparison between WS and socket:
-- WS:
   -- Platform independent: use SOAP
   -- Object-oriented: good for software integration, reusability & decoupling 
   -- Relatively slow: 
      -- Due to the SOAP serialization & deserialization during the data transmission in web service
      -- The performance is also affected by the web container (e.g., tomcat)
      -- If speed is not required, the prefer web service
   -- Standard protocol: no need to customize transission protocol for service development
-- Socket:
   -- Platform independent: socket is the API provided by OS so it has implementation for different PLs (Programming Languages)
   -- Procedure oriented: need to parse the data stream by programmers
   -- Relatively fast: 
      -- Directly transmit data through whatever is parsed
	  -- If speed is required, the prefer socket
   -- Customized protocol: not convenient for service development

WS application scenario:
-- Integration among distributed programs
-- Improve software reusability
-- e.g.:
   -- In SSO envrionment, log-in function can be extracted & published through web service to improve integration & reusability
   -- If publish a public interface (no need to consider the type of client), can use web service
   -- If need to invoke the web service interface, then use web service
   
WS non-application scenario:
-- If A enterprise develops 2 programs using the same PL, then no need to use web service: can use RMI instead
   -- If enterprise|PL is different, then consider web service 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOAP-based WS:
What is SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)?
-- A protocol based on HTTP (which exchanges data based on socket)

What is WSDL (Web Service Definition Language)?
-- A XML-based langauge to describe the functionality offered by WS

What is UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration)?
-- A service to publish & search web service
-- The actual result is not as good as expected: since web service can be also obtained from WSDL

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP-based|RESTful WS:
What is REST?
-- A software architecture style that typically reflects on resource location & operation
-- Resource location: use layered structure to reppresent or locate an URL, instead of using question mark
   -- URL style comparison between SOAP-based & RESTful:
      -- SOAP-based: http://ip:port/queryUser.action?userType=XXX&studentId=001&...
      -- RESTful: http://ip:port/user/student/001/...
-- Resource operation: use "GET|POST|PUT|DELETE" method for database CRUD
-- System|Framework that conforms to the constraints|style of REST is called "RESTful"

What is RESTful WS?
-- Web service is published using REST style

Pros & Cons of REST:
-- Pros: simple & clear
-- Cons: bad readibility if the layer structure is too deep

Others:
What is SSO (Single Sign On)?
-- In multi-system environment, if one user logged on in a system, the user does no need to log on in other systems

Examples of WS framework: CXF, Jersey, etc.
