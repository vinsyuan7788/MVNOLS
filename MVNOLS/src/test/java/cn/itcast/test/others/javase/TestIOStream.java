/**
 * 	This is the class to perform testing regarding I/O stream (Input/Output Stream)
 * 	1. Byte stream: handle I/O of raw binary data (In actual implementation, char-type casting, String constructor & "getByte()" can be manually used to handle translation, which however is not favorable)
 *     -- InputStream & OutputStream (which are abstract classes) are the superclasses of all byte I/O streams
 *     -- File IO: FileInputStream; FileOutputStream
 *     -- Buffered IO: BufferedInputStream & BufferedOutputStream
 *     -- Sequence input: SequenceInputStream
 *     -- Object IO: ObjectInputStream & ObjectOutputStream
 *  2. Character stream: handle I/O of character data, automatically handling translation to and from the local character set (namely "character stream = byte stream + encoding|decoding")
 *     -- Reader & Writer (which are abstract classes) are the superclasses of all character I/O streams
 *     -- File IO: FileReader; FileWriter
 *     -- Buffered IO: BufferedReader; BufferedWriter
 *     -- Byte stream IO: InputStreamReader & OutputStreamWriter 
 *        -- Since usually what stream is returned to use is not determined by us. This stream can convert the (returned) byte stream to character stream
 *        -- Able to specify the encoding|decoding rules (UTF-8, GBK, etc.)
 *        
 *  When to use byte|character stream?
 *  1. If the read|write data involves character (e.g., text, etc.), use character stream
 *     -- Altough byte stream is adoptable, it is risky: if the read-in size does not meet some thresholds, it may mis-encode|decode the characters 
 *  2. If the read|write data does not involve character (e.g., image, audio, etc.), use byte stream
