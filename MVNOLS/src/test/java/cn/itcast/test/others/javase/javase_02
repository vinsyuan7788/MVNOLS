Cohesion & Coupling: refer to "TestOOP.java"
-- Cohesion: a measure of how related the responsibilities of a class are
-- Coupling: a measure of how much the dependency between classes are

Inner class:
-- Should be avoided as much as possible in the design of actual application (*****)
   -- Not good for cohesion & decoupling
-- If inner class: create the inner class directly inside the outer class
   -- CAN access the class (instance|static) variable
   -- NOT create inside the class (instance|static) method: inner class' method cannot access the method's local variable
   
Constructor:
-- Chaining: When the parent class has a construcotr, the child class use "super()" to call it
   -- "super()"
-- Copy constructor: the constructor receiving the object that is same type as current class as argument 
   -- Refer to "TestConstructor.class"
   
Assertion: refer to "TestAssertion.java"
-- Should NOT be used for input validation to a public method
   -- Better option: IllegalArgumenetException, etc.

Reflection: refer to "TestReflection.java"

Collection: refer to "TesCollectionAndMap.java"
-- Using generic type

Serialization & Passivation: refer to "javaweb.testclass.bean.Person.java"
Serialization: store the state of an object in a file or other medium
-- Used for file storage or tranmission: in the environment with distributed cache
   -- Can specify a default serial version ID to avoid version incompatibility, especially when the class in the project is modified and the serialized class is not modified yet
-- Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization
Passivation: store the state of an ServletSession (which has implemented Serializable) object in a file or other medium
-- If other objects (e.g, JavaBean objects) want to go with session, they MUST implement Serializble interface as well
-- Activation is the reverse process of passivation

hashCode() & equals():
-- If equals() is overriden, then hashCode() must be overrided too
   -- Because by default hashCode() compares the memory address between objects, hence to need to overide it for value comparison
