HTTP:
HTTP (Hyper Text Transmission Protocol): protocol for tranmission of hypertext over internet
-- Hyper text: text with meta data
URL (Uniform Resource Location): a representation of HTTP address

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cookie & Session: 
Cookie: data sent from a website|server-side and stored in the user's browser|browser-side
-- Functions: user authenticaion; session identification, etc.
   -- Cookies realize the functions on browser-side; Server realize the functions on server-side
-- Cookie stores text information; session stores text information & objects

Web Servlet|Filter|Listener: refer to the classes under "javaweb.testclass.web" package
Servlet: 
-- Servlet is instantiated by server when servlet is first time accessed or server is started (depends on the "loadOnStartup" configuration in "web.xml")
   -- Singleton-like: since server only instantiates one object for one servlet (even there are multiple servlets) 
      -- Why not singleton: servlet is neither typically instantiated through singleton pattern nor specified as singleton as in frameworks like Spring
-- Servlet is destroyed by servler container when server container is shut down or restarted
-- 3 life-cycle methods: (5 methods in total)
   -- init(): executed once when servlet is created
   -- service(): executed each time the requeset is being processed
   -- destroy(): executed once when the servlet is destroyed
-- Configuration: in "web.xml" file: <servlet> + <servlet-mapping>
-- Servlet chaining: multiple servlets serving the request in chain.
   -- Achieved by: "httpServletRequest.getRequestDispatcher().forward()|include()"
Filter: 
-- Filter is instantiated by server when server is started (since filters do not have "loadOnStartup" for more options of instantiation)
   -- Singleton-like: since server only instantiates one object for one filter (even there are multiple filters)
      -- Why not singleton: servlet is neither typically instantiated through singleton pattern nor specified as singleton as in frameworks like Spring
-- Filter is destroyed by server when server is shut down or restarted
-- 3 life-cycle methods: (3 methods in total)
   -- init(): executed once when filter is instantiated 
   -- doFilter(): executed each time the requeset is being processed
   -- destroy(): executed once when the filter is destroyed
-- Configuration: in "web.xml" file: <filter> + <filter-mapping>
   -- Can filter 4 kinds of access: request|forward|include|error
      -- Intercept request|forward|include to a specific servlet
      -- Intercept a specific servlet to error page 
Listener:
-- The instantiation & destruction of Listener is the same as Filter in principle
-- 8 kinds of listeners:
   -- For application scope: 
      -- ServletContextListener: observe life-cycle change
      -- ServletContextAttributeListener: observe the attribute change
   -- For session scope: 
      -- HttpSessionListener: observe the life-cycle change
      -- HttpSessionAttributeListener: observe the attribute change
   -- For request scope: 
      -- ServletRequestListener: observe the life-cycle change 
      -- ServletRequestAttributeListener: observe the attribute change
   -- For JavaBean: 
      -- HttpSessionBindingListener: observe the session binding 
      -- HttpSessionActivationListener: observe the session passivation
         -- Serialization & Passivation: refer to "javaweb.testclass.bean.Person.java"
	        -- Serialization: store the state of an object in a file or other medium
		       -- Used for file storage or tranmission: in the environment with distributed cache
		       -- Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization
	        -- Passivation: store the state of an ServletSession (which has implemented Serializable) object in a file or other medium
		       -- If other objects (e.g, JavaBean objects) want to go with session, they MUST implement Serializble interface as well
		       -- Activation is the reverse process of passivation
-- Configuration: in "web.xml" file: <listener> (except the 2 listeners for JavaBean)

3 Scopes:
-- Request: the interaction between user and web-app in a single HTTP request
   -- Created when HttpServletRequest is instantiated & ended when HttpServletRequest instance is ended
   -- Operated by "HttpServletRequest httpServletrequest"
-- Session: the interaction between user and web-app in mutliple HTTP requests
   -- Created when HttpSession is instantiated & ended when HttpSession instance is ended
   -- Operated by "HttpSession httpSession"
-- Application (by "ServletContext servletContext"): the interaction between user and web-app across the whole web application life-cycle
   -- Created when web-app (e.g., tomcat) is started & ended when web-app (e.g., tomcat) is ended
   -- Operated by "ServletContext servletContext"

JSP & EL:
What is JSP (Java Server Page)?
-- To generate dynamic web-page based on HTML, XML or other types of documents

JSP life cycle: translation --> compilation --> class-loading --> instantiation --> initialization --> request processing --> destroy

JSP directives: page|include|taglib

JSP built-in|implicit objects:
-- Object page: equivalent to "this"
-- PageContext pageContext: to set|get data in|from page scope
-- HttpServletRequest request: to set|get data in|from request scope
-- HttpServlerResponse response
-- HttpSession session: to set|get data in|from session scope
-- ServletContext application: to set|get data in|from application scope
-- ServletConfig config
-- JSPWriter out
-- Throwable exception

What is EL (Expression Language)?
-- A PL (Programming Language) to embed expression into web page for special purpose
   -- E.g., to store|obtain the data from each scope
 
EL built-in|implicit objects:
-- PageContext pageContext
-- Map pageScope: to set|get data in|from page scope
-- Map requestScope: to set|get data in|from request scope
-- Map sessionScope: to set|get data in|from session scope
-- Map applicationScope: to set|get data in|from application scope
-- Map param & Map paramValues
-- Map header & Map headerValues
-- Map cookie
-- Map initParam

EL default|implicit search|query order from scope:
-- From "pageScope" to "applicationScope"

JDBC:
C3P0 & DBCP: C3P0 is better
-- C3P0 supports multiple databse connections
-- C3P0 supports re-connection when the connection is off

The step of JDBC executing SQL:
-- 1. Get the connection 
-- 2. Write SQL to PreparedStatement for execution 
-- 3. Process the result
-- 4. Catch the exception if there is any
-- 5. Close the resource

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Server:
Servers that do not support JavaEE stardard: Tomcat, GlassFish
-- They only supports Java Web (part of JavaEE standard)
Servers that support JavaEE stardard: JBoss, Resin, Weblogic, Websphere
-- Typically supporting JavaEE stardard means supporting EJB

Tomcat: application server
Apache: web server
