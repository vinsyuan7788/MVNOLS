Need to add a column "itemStock" in database for further implementation & validation of shopping cart & order module, then:
-- Do the MyBatis reverse engineering: get the necessary classes
-- Copy the code that have been written in the original "itemMapper.xml" before covering the original "itemMapper.xml" with new "itemMapper.xml" (which is generated by MyBatis reverse engineering)
   -- Then paste the written codes to the new "itemMapper.xml" & perform the testing 
-- In item administration module, add a field "stock" in all the JSP view
   -- Namely: WEB-INF/jsp/admin/item/itemAdd.jsp, jsp/admin/item/itemDetail.jsp
-- In the shopping module, add a JQuery validation to validate the purchase amount for each item (no more than the stock)
   -- Namely: WEB-INF/ftl/item/itemDetail.html
