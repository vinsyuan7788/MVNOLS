1. In Maven web project, if the configuraiton in Spring is correct, but it always says that "ClassIsNotFound"
	-- Check "classes" folder in current project under "webapps" folder, see if there is any compilation .class file
		-- Usually is no, hence needs to re-compile the java file, refers to "BookMarks" - "Software Engineering" - "MyEclipse"
		
2. Check "cn.itcast.cms.service.impl.StaticPageGenerationServiceImpl" for more support

3. Servlet JSP tag: here needs to be very careful.
   The jars like "servlet-api" & "jsp-api" are included inside the tomcat. If user introduces the jars
   with theese names, it will override these built-in jars & may bring some troubles when complying servlet
   or JSP.
   For example: the maven dependency shown as following will lead to an JSP class compilation exception
   <dependency>
	   <groupId>javax.servlet.jsp</groupId>
	   <artifactId>jsp-api</artifactId>
	   <version>2.0</version>
   </dependency>
