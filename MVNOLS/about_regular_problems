1. Validation problems:
-- If want MyEclipse to ignore the validation of some files (e.g., some JS files, etc.)
    -- Right click that file: "MyEclipse" --> "Exclude from validation"

2. Jar problems:
-- Servlet JSP tag in "pom.xml" when using Maven: here needs to be very careful.
   The jars like "servlet-api" & "jsp-api" are included inside the tomcat. If user introduces the jars
   with these names, it will override these built-in jars & may bring some troubles when complying servlet
   or JSP.
   For example: the maven dependency shown as following will lead to an JSP class compilation exception
   <dependency>
	   <groupId>javax.servlet.jsp</groupId>
	   <artifactId>jsp-api</artifactId>
	   <version>2.0</version>
   </dependency> 
     
3. Compilation problems:
-- In Maven web project, if the configuraiton in Spring is correct, but it always says that "ClassIsNotFound"
   -- Check "webapps/[CurrentProject]/WEB-INF/classes" folder under the server (e.g., tomcat), see if there is any compilation ".class" file
   -- Usually is no, hence needs to re-compile the java file, refers to "BookMarks" --> "Software Engineering" --> "MyEclipse" --> "Tomcat 6.0/webapps/..."
	  -- Adopts the way 1 and 2: namely make sure "project --> build automatically" is clicked, then "project --> clean"
	  -- Check "cn.itcast.cms.service.impl.StaticPageGenerationServiceImpl" for more support information
-- For "CHKJ3000E: WAR Validation Failed: java.lang.NullPointerException":
   -- Still check "webapps/[CurrentProject]/WEB-INF/classes" folder under the server (e.g., tomcat), see if there is any compilation ".class" file
   -- Usually is no: hence adopts the same way for resolution
